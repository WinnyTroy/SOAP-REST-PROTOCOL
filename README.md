# SOAP-REST-PROTOCOL  


# SOAP   
 (former acronym for Simple Object Access Protocol) is an object-oriented RPC protocol built on XML.  
 It allows the transmission of messages between remote objects, which means that it allows an object to invoke methods of objects physically located on another server, and is most often done using the HTTP protocol, however, other protoolz may apply.  
 
 
# REST 
REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architecture style that is based on the HTTP protocol. ie A resource (via its unique URI) is accessed to perform various operations (GET read, POST write, PUT modification, DELETE deletion), operations that are natively supported by the HTTP protocol.
